# whack-a-mole

The project consist in a FrontEnd with Vite and a simple Backend with Express just to store in memory the player's score and some player's data mocked in.

You will need:

- [NodeJs 18.13 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

You can change the server host by changhing the .env file, like demonstrated in .env.example
The default url to Backend is 'http://localhost:3001'

I left in the package.json a script to Start all the project more easly. After the Download the project, run one of this commands to download the peckages. This will downlaod the packages of the Front and Backend together:

- yarn intallPackages
- npm run intallPackages

After that you can run "server" to start the server, "dev" to start the FrontEnd, or "project" to start both on same time

- yarn dev
- npm run dev

- yarn server
- npm run server

---

- yarn project
- npm run project
